At right-side of the Heart,the de-oxygenated blood comes from the Veins and goes to the 
Inferior Vena Cava[ big Vein at bottom side of the Heart] and Superior Vena Cava[ big Vein at 
upper side of the Heart],which connects to the Heart.<BR>[1] The blood from the 
Superior Vena Cava,
which connects to the Heart, goes to the Right Atrium and then to the 
Right Ventricle,Blood goes to the Heart and then goes to the lungs through 
Pulmonary Artery for oxygenation of blood and then this Oxygeneted 
blood goes to the Heart by Pulmonary Vein , the Heart pumpes the 
Oxygeneted Blood to the Left Atrium and then to the Left Ventricle
and then the Blood is pumped to the Aorta [ big Artery.]<I>[DISCUSSED LATER.]</I><BR>[2]The blood from the Inferior
Vena Cava which also connects to the Heart;the blood goes to the Right Atrium and

by Pulmonary Vein , the Heart pumpes the blood to the Aorta.

    <H2 >
    The aorta has four different vessesls to pump the blood to all parts of the body of a human.<BR> 
    <B>The Human body needs the oxygen to produce energy,this oxygen is transportaed by the RBC to all 
        the parts of the body.The RBC's are forced to move by Heart and are supplied by the 
        Aorta to all parts of the human body.
        The body produces energy by the body cells. And Oxygen then becomes 
into Carbon-dioxyde and this De-Oxygenated Blood then goes to Vena Cava and the process gets repeated.</H2><BR>

<P id="men">Highly doubted questions about Heart-</P><BR>

<H1 class="omg" id="cat">You might have wondered that our heart pumps 
    throught our lifetime,but never gets tired OR takes rest.Do you know why?</H1>

<h2> the heart is made of a Muscle named-Myocardium and is made up of Cardiomyocytes.
The Myocardium is found in the walls of all four chambers of the heart,it is 
thicker in the ventricles and thinner in the atria.These are special muscle which 
can't get tired,& can pump the blood throught our lifetime.</h2><BR><BR>


<H1 class="omg" id="mat">Do you know how does the heart pumps the blood?Means how the blood is pressuraised to move?</H1>

<H2>Suppose you are holding a mop which is wet and you squeeze it,the water is forced to move and when we realease the 
 preasure of your hands,the air particles are forced to move inside the fine hairy particles of mop;this is how we 
 can simplify the movement of heart.In complicated version,when the Oxygenated blood comes from the Pulmonary and goes 
 to the Left Atrium & to the Left Ventricle,the left side of the Heart contracts itself to push the blood to 
 Aorta.The blood flows fast while the right side of the heart moves alternatingly to the opposite side to also push the 
 blood.Also a little vaccume is created in Right Aturium & Ventricle,so the De-Oxyegenated blood is forced to move 
 towards the Vena cava's and then to the right atrium and ventricle which then goes to the lungs by Pulmonary Artery.</H2><BR>


 <h1 class="omg" id="rat">Do you know why our Heart beats faster when we run,jump,exersise,get suddenly scared,feeling 
    nervous or while inhaling after air after holding breath for a long time?</h1>

<h2>Sometimes when our body gets involved in a tiering activity,and if our body lacks oxygen to produce energy,
    our body automaticly inhales & exhales a lot of oxygen,to circulate this oxygen the Heart beats faster.
    This happens when someone exersises,do sudden movements,jump or play outdoor activities.But when you 
    forcely stop the flow of oxygen you can get Nausea,Headache,Vommiting,production of LCTOS,
    unconsciousness and in rare cases even death because of too much heavy exersise with the lack of oxygen.
    In the cases of feeling scared or nervous,the Brain tries to get rid of that situation as fast as possible 
    and process harder to find the solution.And also the cause gets much attention by the Brain so that 
    Brain can quickly react to that situation to save itself from that cause,in this process high 
    amount of Oxygen is required to produce energy.And so we breath faster and the Heart beats faster.</h2>

        in opposite direction to the other hand.Most people think that the Heart work on contracting itself,
        yes it is true,but the Heart dosen't contraps in a single peice.The Right Atrium & Right Ventricle 
        move opposite to the Left Atrium & Left Ventricle to pump the blood.</LI></OL></h2>

        produce energy.But in times when the movement stops,CPR are given to people.The person who is 
        giving the oxygen to should not INHALE the oxygen, but should some air in mouth & forcely given 
        to the person so that it could enter the lungs and then should pump the chests fastly so that circulation 
        of oxygenated blood circulates the body,after some pumps you should take the De-Oxygenated blood in mouth 
        and not in your lungs.Then reapeat this process until emergency service[s]/AMBULANCE arrives or the person 
        wakes up[which is rare].</h2>

<P id="nan">HOW DO OUR LUNGS EXPAND & CONDENSE</P>

<H2>In Human body,the DIAPHRAGM pulls and pushs the lungs.When the Diaphragm pulls the lungs,it provids 
vaccume and the air is forced to come in by the help of either Nose or Mouth.Small root like structure 
in lungs which provides Oxygen to our Heart by Pulmonary Vein and the Oxygenated Blood goes to every 
part and every organ of the Human body and then De-Oxygenated blood comes to the Heart and then goes 
to the Lungs by Pulmonary Artery and then the Diaphragm condense to realease this compparision of 
air by either Nose or Mouth. 
</H2>


<P id="van">WHY DO SOME PEOPLE SUFFER FROM LUNGS FAILURE BECAUSE OF BAD AIR QUALITY AND CIGARETTES</P>

<H2>When we inhale air in,our nose purifies the air and then the purified air is taken into the Lungs,
but if we take this unpurified air in by the mouth it does not gets purified and it gets to the Lungs 
unpurified.We can remove the wastes{unpurified air particles blocked}from the Nose,they are called 
Booger.But in the case of,it can't be cleaned like of Nose,overtime Unpurified air is filtered by the 
Lungs and the Lungs get dirtier.<br>While the Cigarettes are used only by the Mouth,the Unpurified air 
get to Lungs,the Lungs purifies it.Overtime the dirty air particle make bigger and bigger clot which 
makes the circulation of oxygen a lot harder{and can even cause Lungs cancer because of infection 
of DNA in Lungs}.The person might not get sufficient oxygen in time causing him/her to colapse/
feeling unconsciousness/nausea/headache/or in rare cases death is possible.So,the moral is do not 
use Cigarettes,and try inhale oxygen through Nose,unless in VERY TIRED CONDITION.</H2>
